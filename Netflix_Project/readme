## 🛠️ Process & Methodology

After importing the dataset into Python, the following steps were taken:

### ✅ Data Cleaning
- Checked for and confirmed that **no missing or NaN values** are present.
- Converted the `Release_Date` column from string to proper **datetime format**, and extracted the **year**.
- Removed non-essential columns that were irrelevant to the analysis.
- Normalized the `Genre` column, which originally contained a list of genres, by **exploding it into individual rows** for easier analysis.
- Used the `pd.cut()` function to **bin continuous variables** into categorical intervals for better grouping and visualization.

### 📈 Basic Analysis Performed
- Identified the most frequent movie genres.
- Determined the movie with the **highest vote average**.
- Found movies with the **highest and lowest popularity**, along with their genres.
- Analyzed which **year** had the highest number of movie releases.
