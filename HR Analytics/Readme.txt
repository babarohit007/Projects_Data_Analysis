Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition using HR data to uncover meaningful insights that can help organizations improve employee retention strategies.

🎯 Objective
To provide actionable insights into employee attrition trends by analyzing HR data using Excel and Power BI. The key focus areas include salary structure, age group, education, job roles, and tenure.

📂 Data Preparation Steps
🔹 Initial Data Handling (Excel):
Data Loaded from Excel files.

Basic Cleaning Performed:

Null Columns Removed to reduce noise.

Duplicate Rows Deleted for accuracy.

Name Mismatches Identified in the Business Travel column (e.g., "Travel_Frequently" vs "Travel Frequently").

Data Validation:

Checked for consistency across key fields (e.g., age, salary, job roles).

Data Transformations:

Age Binning: Employees grouped into age ranges for analysis (e.g., 20–25, 26–35, etc.).

Salary Binning: Salary ranges created to understand attrition patterns across pay brackets.

🔹 Data Handling in Power BI (Power Query):
Data Imported into Power BI using Power Query.

Initial Cleaning Reapplied:

Confirmed removal of nulls and duplicates.

Fixed inconsistent values.

Attrition Conversion:

Text values for Attrition (e.g., "Yes", "No") converted to Numeric Format (1 = Yes, 0 = No) for calculation and visualization purposes.

📊 Dashboard and Insights
A comprehensive dashboard was developed to visualize:

Attrition by Salary Range

Attrition by Age Group

Attrition by Department and Job Role

Education Background vs. Attrition

Tenure and Attrition Relationship

Key Metrics Summary (e.g., total employees, attrition rate, average salary)
